Pirate Proxy List 2024: Unblock The Pirate Bay
##################


Proxy sites are the easiest methods to bypass the block. `Pirate Proxy List <https://unblocktorrent.org/piratebay-proxy-unblock/>`_ maintains a list of proxy sites that allow access to The Pirate Bay. Since 2011 ISPs in the UK, Netherland, Belgium and now France have been blocking many file sharing websites including The PirateBay. However their efforts seem to be counterproductive as Torrenting and other file sharing traffic is not decreasing. This is due to the help of information websites such as Torrent Proxy Portals that provide an up to date proxy list for ThePirateBay (TPB), and further information on how to avoid censorship using alternate methods. We periodically check our Pirate Bay proxy list against several major ISPs around Europe to make sure they have not been blocked.

Countries blocking access to The Pirate Bay
*********


The Pirate Bay has been banned on various internet service providers (ISPs) around the world. These countries include:


1. Argentina
------------


The Argentine National Communications Commission (CNC) ordered the blocking of The Pirate Bay's domains on June 30, 2014. This was due to a lawsuit between The Pirate Bay and the Argentine Chamber of Recording Industries (CAPIF). The CNC used this order to force ISPs to block The Pirate Bay's IP range and 12 specific domains.


2. Australia
------------

In September 2014, discussions were held about whether ISPs in Australia should be required to block popular torrent sites like The Pirate Bay.On December 15, 2016, the Australian Federal Court ruled in favor of banning access to The Pirate Bay, isoHunt, SolarMovie, and the now-defunct torrent sites Torrentz and TorrentHound. 

The ruling forced internet service providers (ISPs) to implement these bans before January 5th. Judge Nicholas stated that he was pleased with the decision, saying that it was evident that the owners of these websites had openly and deliberately infringed on copyright. Despite some success in blocking access through ISPs, VPNs and DNS changes can still allow users to access these sites.


3. Austria
------------

In Austria, starting from May 30th, 2016, ISPs are allowed to unblock previously blocked websites. However, starting in 2018, they will have to re-implement these blocks.


4. Belgium
------------

Belgium has not yet announced any specific plans regarding the future of these website bans.After the founders of The Pirate Bay lost their case in 2009, the Belgian Anti-Piracy Foundation (BAF) tried to get two ISPs, Belgacom and Telenet, to block access to the site for their customers. After years of negotiation, legal action was taken. In July 2010, the Antwerp Commercial Court ruled that neither ISP should block The Pirate Bay, calling the idea of blocking wholesale locations "disproportionate." 

The ISPs said they were not in a position to decide which websites their customers could or could not access. BAF accused the ISPs of providing a "safe haven" for The Pirate Bay and appealed the decision.In October 2011, the Court of Appeal in Antwerp overturned the decision of the Commercial Court and ordered Belgacom and Telenet to block 11 domains associated with The Pirate Bay within 14 days, or face fines. A representative from Pirate Bay commented that this move would have the opposite effect, as there are numerous options available, and that it would only bring more traffic. 

The court order specified which domain names were to be blocked, including the "www" version of each URL. ISPs also blocked these domains in an attempt to enforce the "spirit of the law", even though the court order did not specifically mention this. NURPA, a non-profit organization that advocates for digital rights, privacy, and freedom of expression in Belgium, condemned this decision, calling it a dangerous precedent that could lead to internet censorship in Belgium.It is inconsistent with the doctrine of proportionality as defended by the European Court of Human Rights.

On October 5th, 2011, the Pirate Bay registered two domain names: depiraatbaai.be and baiedespirates.be, so that Belgian users could access the website without using alternative DNS providers. However, on April 18th, 2012, TorrentFreak reported that these two domain names had also been banned.


5. China
------------

In China, the site was briefly blocked and then unblocked again in November 2008, along with other BitTorrent sites. As of January 2017, it is no longer accessible from mainland China.


6. Denmark
------------

In response, Pirate Bay created an alternative website with instructions on how to circumvent the block. The IFPI, an industry association representing the interests of music and film producers, welcomed the court's decision and encouraged other ISPs to take similar measures.

On November 26, 2008, the Eastern High Court upheld the verdict. Following this decision, TDC, another major ISP in Denmark, also blocked access to Pirate Bay in order to prevent further copyright infringement.Other Danish ISPs have stated that they would rather not disrupt their customers' communication, but they reluctantly implemented the lock to avoid fines. Tele2's owner, Telenor, appealed the Supreme Court's decision to the Danish Supreme Court in April 2009, which accepted the case. In May 2010, the court rejected the appeal and ordered Tele2 to continue the lock.On October 26, 2011, the Helsinki District Court ordered Elisa Oyj, one of Finland's leading internet service providers, to stop providing copyrighted materials from the Pirate Bay website by November 18, 2011. If the company failed to comply, it could face a fine of up to 100,000 euros.

In response to the ruling, Elisa activated a ban on thepiratebay.org based on its IP and DNS addresses. The company has since filed a complaint with the court about the decision.


7. Finland
------------

Additionally, DNA and Telia, formerly known as Sonera, have also blocked access to the site following a similar ruling by the Helsinki court in 2012. These three companies - Elisa, Telia, and DNA - together control more than 80% of the market for internet service providers in Finland.


8. France
------------

On December 4, 2014, France's High Court ordered major internet service providers to block access to The Pirate Bay for two weeks.


9. Germany
------------

On May 13, 2010, the Hamburg District Court issued an injunction against CB3Rob Ltd & Co KG (Cyberbunker) and its operator, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, to prevent the Pirate Bay website from connecting to the internet. The motion picture association member companies requested this precautionary measure.


10. Greece
------------

In Greece, Tellas / WIND Hellas Internet service providers blocked the site from February 15, 2010 until the end of March 2010 due to the blocking in Italy, as traffic was apparently routed through Wind Italy's servers. Since November 9, 2018, all Greek internet providers are legally required to block access to Pirate Bay for at least three years.On May 4th, 2012, several file sharing and video streaming websites, including Pirate Bay, were blocked in India by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), without any prior warning or explanation. The ban was imposed due to a court order issued by the Madras High Court, which was adopted by a Chennai-based copyright lab. Various internet service providers (ISPs), such as Airtel, Reliance Communications, Tikona Digital Networks, Aircel, MTNL, BSNL, and Vodafone, enforced the ban, while some ISPs, like You Broadband, Nextra Broadband, and Hathway, did not.


11. India
------------

On May 19th, 2012, visitors to the websites continued to see an error message stating that the website had been blocked "until further notice, either under court orders or as directed by the Ministry of Telecommunications". In May of 2012, an anonymous group hacked into the Reliance Communications server in protest, demonstrating the security weaknesses used to implement the ban.On June 22nd, 2012, the Madras High Court lifted a block on certain websites, clarifying that only specific web addresses containing illegal copies should be blocked, rather than entire websites. This decision restored access to video and file-sharing sites in India, including The Pirate Bay.

However, in July 2014, the site was blocked again due to violations of guidelines regarding FIFA broadcasting activities in certain countries. Visitors are now greeted with the message "This website has been blocked by the instructions of a competent authority." Several ISPs, such as BSNL, Airtel, and Vodafone India, continue to block the site, even though they no longer display personalized messages to users visiting the Pirate Bay. However, most other ISPs continue to allow access to the site.


12. Indonesia
------------

The Pirate Bay has been blocked by several Internet service providers in Indonesia, including Telkom Indonesia and possibly other ISPs. These providers redirect users who try to access the website without a proxy to a different website managed by Kemkominfo, the Indonesian Ministry of Telecommunications and Information. The website claims that the Pirate Bay is blocked because of its content, which includes pornographic materials and other harmful content.


13. Ireland
------------

In January 2009, the Irish ISP Eircom was brought to court by four major music record labels - EMI, Sony, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music - for monitoring its customers and detecting illegal file sharing activities. After eight days of court proceedings, the parties reached an agreement to implement a step-by-step policy to identify and separate customers involved in copyright infringement. The Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA) is still negotiating similar agreements with other ISPs.

On February 21st, 2009, Eircom announced they would soon block access to the Pirate Bay. However, access was restored on February 24th, 2009. Eircom again blocked access on August 20th, 2009 and has since announced plans to block the site permanently from September 2009 onwards. As of September 1st, Eircom's block is in place, but subscribers to other Irish ISPs can still access the site using proxy servers.On April 16, 2010, Irish High Court Judge Peter Charleton ruled that the three-strikes policy was legal, describing Pirate Bay as a website that "deals with the robbery of copyright law by mainly focusing on musical works belonging to the plaintiffs." After the verdict was issued, the judge received threats that his life could be "destroyed by computers."

In April 2011, the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice issued a written statement stating that, in their opinion, no internet service provider (ISP) can be obligated to filter the internet and, in particular, enforce copyright laws. This view was mainly confirmed by the European Court of Justice in a judgment issued in November 2011.

Additionally, in December 2011, a decision was made against Eircom's "Three Strikes" online file-sharing system regarding data protection concerns when recording IP addresses.On June 12th, 2013, the court ordered EMI, Sony, Warner Music, and Universal to block access to The Pirate Bay on behalf of several companies, including UPC, Imagine, Vodafone, Digiweb, Hutchison 3G Ltd., and Telefónica O2 Ireland Ltd., giving them 30 days to comply.


14. Iran
------------

In Iran, The Pirate Bay is currently blocked.


15. Italy
------------

Italy has also taken action against The Pirate Bay.In mid-2008, an Italian association filed a lawsuit against music piracy in Italy, following criminal charges in Sweden. The deputy prosecutor took the case to the Bergamo Preliminary Investigations Court, which on August 1st, 2008, decided to block Italian internet service providers from accessing the Pirate Bay website. The decision was based on preventing copyright infringement by users on Italian territory.

After the block went into effect, the Pirate Bay responded by instructing its users to repair the lock on August 10th, 2008. However, some ISPs had already blocked the alternative site. Some ISPs implemented the block by redirecting traffic from the Pirate Bay to a website owned by IFPI, a music industry organization. Italian security expert Matteo Flora warned that by redirecting users to their own website, IFPI may have access to the cookies of users and impersonate them on the Pirate Bay's official website.

Two Italian IT lawyers, Giovanni Battista Gallus and Francesco Micozzi, and a forensic scientist, Matteo Flora, appealed to the Bergamo court. The court examined the case and on September 24, 2008, overturned the original decision. The decision was based on the "Freeze" section of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure. This section prohibits taking action against parties who are not involved in a potential crime. With the April 2009 ruling in Sweden as precedent, the prosecutor in Bergamo appealed the Italian decision to the Supreme Court of Cassation in order to restore the block. In September 2009, the Supreme Court reversed the decision to remove the block and the case was returned to the Bergamo court for further examination. On February 8, 2010, the Italian Supreme Court again blocked the website. Since 2014, the website has only been blocked at the DNS level by some ISPs in Italy. However, it is still accessible through lesser-known methods.


16. Malaysia
------------

In June 2011, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission issued a letter to all internet service providers (ISPs) in Malaysia, ordering them to block The Pirate Bay and several other file-sharing websites. The block was based on a violation of Section 41 of the Copyright Act of 1987, which prohibits illegal copying of copyrighted materials. However, the block was lifted in July 2014.
On June 4, 2015, Malaysia re-imposed the block on The Pirate Bay. As of 2018, the website appears to be unblocked, possibly due to a lack of interest or a change in government policy.


17. Holland
------------

On July 21, 2005, the Amsterdam District Court issued an injunction against the individuals responsible for The Pirate Bay. This was the result of a hearing following a subpoena from the Dutch record industry association, BREIN, who had filed an urgent complaint regarding copyright infringement by third parties. The defendants had not attended the hearing and did not agree to be represented. As a result, on July 30, 2009, the court issued a default judgement against them and upheld the claims of the plaintiff. Neij, Kolmisoppi, and Warg were ordered to "cease and desist from any further copyright and related law violations by Stichting Brein in the Netherlands" by August 9, 2009. 

Failure to comply would result in daily fines of up to 30,000 euros, with a maximum penalty of 3 million euros. They were also ordered to pay for legal costs. Additionally, in a separate case handled at the same time, the court imposed the same fines on Global Gaming Factory X, the expected new owner of The Pirate Bay, for continuing to infringe on copyright after acquiring the website.According to Tim Kuik, the director of BREIN, this was the first time a foreign website had been instructed to block access from the Netherlands. However, BREIN waived the August payment and allowed the website to remain online until the expected change of ownership at the end of August 2009.


On October 2nd, 2009, the Pirate Bay's hosting services were transferred to Ukraine and traffic was redirected through the Netherlands. BREIN contacted NForce, the ISP, and the service was terminated. Pirate Bay then relocated to a cyberbunker on the outskirts of Kloetinge, in the southern Netherlands.On January 11, 2012, a court in The Hague issued an order to two Dutch internet service providers (Ziggo and XS4ALL) to block access to the Pirate Bay website and its IP addresses. The order went into effect on January 31st, 2012 and would remain in place until further notice.
In May 2012, five additional ISPs (UPC, KPN, T-Mobile, Tele2, and Telfort) were also ordered to block access to Pirate Bay. Following a complaint from BREIN, the Dutch Pirate Party was ordered by a court in The Hague to stop advertising methods for bypassing the blockade, including linking to proxy servers offered by the party. The party also claimed that they were prevented by law from linking to Tor.On January 28, 2014, the Hague Court of Appeals ruled that the ongoing blockade of the Pirate Bay was ineffective and easy to circumvent. As a result, Ziggo and XS4ALL were no longer required to block access to the website.
	
	
18. Norway
------------

On November 13, 2015, the Supreme Court further ruled that the findings of the Court of Appeal regarding the effectiveness of the blockade were in conflict with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. The Supreme Court referred preliminary questions regarding the activities of The Pirate Bay to the Court of Justice to determine whether they constitute "notice to the public" and, if not, whether a judicial ban could be imposed on ISPs that facilitated infringing activities.

In 2017, European judges ruled that the previous decision from 2012 did not violate European law, allowing national courts within the European Union to implement web blocks on copyrighted content. This case was then referred back to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands, which continued to rule on the matter in January 2018. However, after the European Court of Justice's decision invalidated the 2014 ruling, ISPs were once again forced to block the Pirate Bay while awaiting the Supreme Court's final decision. On January 12, the block was extended to include ISPs such as KPN, Tele2, T-Mobile, Zeelandnet, and CAIW. Vodafone was indirectly affected by the merger with Ziggo after this decision.


19. Portugal
------------

In December 2014, Vodafone blocked thepiratebay.se and instead directed it to the website mobilegen.vodafone.pt/denied/dn with the message "The website you wish to consult has been blocked by a court decision." Further. (The website you are trying to access is blocked by court order.)

MEO and NOS have blocked thepiratebay.se at the DNS level and displayed a message similar to "The site you are trying to access has been blocked in a court order enforcement sequence" message. (The site you are trying to access has been blocked due to compliance with the judicial mandate.)



20. Qatar
------------

File sharing and video streaming sites such as The Pirate Bay are blocked in Qatar.


21. Romania
------------

RCS & RDS, UPC Romania, Telekom Romania, Nextgen Communication, Digital Cable Systems, and AKTA Telekom have blocked customer access to three pirate sites for films and series (filmehd.net and filmeonline2013.biz) for Internet users in Romania. Operators are now required to prohibit access to these websites from their systems.

This decision was made by several film production companies, including Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Universal City Studios Productions LLP, Universal Cable Productions LLC, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Paramount Pictures Corporation, Disney Enterprises, Columbia Pictures Industries, and Sony Pictures Television. According to the court decision, customers' DNS blocking methods will permanently block these websites for Internet services. The decision can be found on the Justice Register as of November 5, 2018.The decision is not final and may be appealed.



22. Russia
------------

Pirate Bay was blocked by several major internet service providers across the country in June 2015 due to the state's blocking of websites that contain files or references to files that violate copyright laws.


23. Saudi Arabia
------------

The Ministry of Culture and Information in Saudi Arabia blocked Pirate Bay and other torrent websites in August 2014.


24. Singapore
------------

The Singaporean government planned to block certain websites, including The Pirate Bay, in order to prevent copyright infringement. As a result, it proposed amending the Copyright Act in August 2014. However, the amendment was later repealed on November 29, 2014. In February 2016, the government ruled that websites that infringe copyright should be blocked. In a surprising move, the government ordered all internet service providers in Singapore to block 53 websites, including Pirate Bay, at the request of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The internet service providers affected were Singtel, M1, StarHub, MyRepublic, and ViewQwest.

25. Spain
------------

Since January 2015, Vodafone Spain has been blocking thepiratebay.org at the request of the Interior Ministry. Since March 29, 2015, the pirate bay has been blocked under various URLs by all ISPs in Spain.

According to the Ministry of Culture and Sports of Spain, there were procedures in place from June 2014 to November 2018 to block various associated domains, including those ending with .se, .org, .net, and .com.


26. Sweden
------------

In May 2010, the Swedish Internet service provider for Pirate Bay lost an appeal against a court order to stop providing services to the website. Despite having already fulfilled an earlier contract in August 2009, and The Pirate Bay moving to a new location, the ISP chose in June 2010 to block its customers from accessing The Pirate Bay from their new location. A judge in the case noted that the order did not specifically require the ISP to monitor its customers' access to the site, but the ISP wished to avoid any potential legal issues.

On February 13, 2017, the Swedish Patent and Market Court ruled that broadband providers must block their customers' access to file sharing site The Pirate Bay, overturning a previous district court decision in the opposite direction from 2015.

27. Turkey
------------

The Pirate Bay was blocked in Turkey for the first time in September 2007, but the ban was lifted before it was re-blocked by the Turkish government on October 30th, 2014. Since then, access to the site has been restored.


28. United Arab Emirates
------------

In the United Arab Emirates, Pirate Bay has been blocked since September 2013, with the exception of the adult content section. Recently, a mirror site at thepiratebay.ae has been created to bypass the block.
	
	
29. United Kingdom (UK)
------------

The United Kingdom has not blocked Pirate Bay, although it has been reported that some ISPs may choose to block it.On February 20, 2012, the London High Court ruled that The Pirate Bay facilitates copyright infringement. The operators of The Pirate Bay were not present at the hearing. On April 30, 2012, Judge Arnold Sky ordered BT, Everything Everywhere, TalkTalk, O2, and Virgin Media to block access to the website. BT requested a few more weeks to further review their position. Virgin Media began blocking access to The Pirate Bay on May 2nd, 2012.

A source from The Pirate Bay stated that they had 12 million more visitors the day after the ban compared to the day before. They commented, "We should thank BIS."

BT adjusted its cleanfeed system to enforce the ban. The Pirate Bay responded by stating, "As always, there are ways to bypass the blockade. Use a VPN service to remain anonymous and access uncensored content. You should do this anyway."

A study by Lund University found that 15- to 25-year-olds using VPNs increased by 40% from 2009 to 2020.On June 10, 2012, TalkTalk began blocking its UK customers from accessing The Pirate Bay. O2 and Sky Broadband also implemented the block, and on June 19, BT joined them. When users try to access The Pirate Bay via BT, they receive an "Error: Site Blocked" message. Other Internet Service Providers (ISPs) also display a message explaining the court order, with the Pirate Bay logo and a link to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) website.

According to ISP data in mid-July, P2P (peer-to-peer) traffic in the UK decreased by 11% immediately after the ban was implemented, but then it quickly recovered to nearly the same levels as before the ban. The ISP submitted these numbers anonymously to BBC.

In December 2012, the proxy for The Pirate Bay, operated by the Pirate Party UK, was shut down after the UK recording industry threatened legal action.

How to access The Pirate Proxy ecurely 
*********

Here we have provided the list of some of the fastest, most functional mirror clones in the world that are safe to access. The list of all pirate proxies mentioned on our website is checked regularly and goes through the verification process before they are put into operation. The following lists are checked daily for availability and then sorted by country and speed. 

These mirror clones are completely free and securely accessible. However, we recommend that you use a premium VPN service to access and download content from a torrent website as the government of many countries have strict laws against downloading pirated torrent websites. In countries like the United Kingdom and the United States of America, many people have evidence of copyright infringement from the ISP that could lead to a legal claim. 

To protect yourself from such a situation, we recommend that you use ProtonVPN, a free and highly secure VPN on the market to protect your internet identity from your government and make you anonymous on the internet.
