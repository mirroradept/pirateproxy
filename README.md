# Pirate Proxy List 2024: Unblock The Pirate Bay


Proxy sites are the easiest methods to bypass the block. Pirate Proxy List maintains a list of proxy sites that allow access to The Pirate Bay. Since 2011 ISPs in the UK, Netherland, Belgium and now France have been blocking many file sharing websites including The PirateBay. However their efforts seem to be counterproductive as Torrenting and other file sharing traffic is not decreasing. This is due to the help of information websites such as Torrent Proxy Portals that provide an up to date proxy list for ThePirateBay (TPB), and further information on how to avoid censorship using alternate methods. We periodically check our Pirate Bay proxy list against several major ISPs around Europe to make sure they have not been blocked.

## Countries blocking access to The Pirate Bay


The Pirate Bay has been blocked on many ISP's around the world.
Countries blocking access to The Pirate Bay where at least one internet service provider (ISP) formerly or currently censors TPB. 


### 1. Argentina


On June 30, 2014, the Argentine CNC (National Communications Commission) ordered the blocking of all domains of The Pirate Bay. The order came about as a result of a lawsuit between the site and CAPIF (Argentine Chamber of Record Manufacturers). Using this order, the CNC had the ISPs block the IP range 194.71.107.0 to 194.71.107.255 in which The Pirate Bay operates and 12 different domains from The Pirate Bay.


### 2. Australia


In September 2014, the Australian government announced that it was discussing whether ISPs should be forced to block popular torrent sites, including The Pirate Bay.

On December 15, 2016, the Australian federal court ruled to proceed with the ban, forcing ISPs to ban access to The Pirate Bay, isoHunt, and SolarMovie, as well as the now-defunct Torrentz and TorrentHound, before January 5. Judge Nicholas said, "I am pleased that the relief from copyright infringement is evident and that the operator of the TPB websites has openly and deliberately disregarded the rights of copyright owners." Despite some success with ISPs blocking access, VPNs or changing DNS can still easily access sites like The Pirate Bay.


### 3. Austria


From May 30, 2016, Austrian ISPs will be able to unblock all previously blocked sites.

Starting in 2018, ISPs will have to block websites again.


### 4. Belgium


After the founders of The Pirate Bay lost their verdict in 2009, the Belgian Anti-Piracy Foundation (BAF) campaigned for two ISPs, Belgacom and Telenet, to block subscribers' access to the website. After years of negotiations, legal action was taken. In July 2010, the Antwerp Commercial Law Bank ruled that none of the ISPs should block the pirate bay and described the idea of ​​blocking wholesale locations as "disproportionate". ISPs said it was not their position to decide which websites their users can and cannot access. BAF accused them of providing a safe haven for The Pirate Bay and appealed.

In October 2011, the Antwerp Court of Appeal overturned the Commercial Court's decision and ordered Belgacom and Telenet to initiate DNS blocks of 11 domains linked to The Pirate Bay or face fines within 14 days. A spokesman for Pirate Bay said this move would only have the opposite effect as there are many options, commenting, "This will only bring us more traffic, as always. Thanks for the free publicity." The court order listed the domain names to be blocked, including "www". The corresponding URLs without "www". They were also blocked by ISPs trying to uphold the "spirit of the law", although the court order did not specify it. NURPA, a Belgian non-profit advocacy group that promotes and protects digital rights, freedom of expression, privacy and civil liberties, condemned the decision, saying: "The Antwerp Court of Appeal's decision in the case against Belgacom BAF / Telenet sets a dangerous precedent for the lockdown of content from internet service providers in Belgium. It is inconsistent with the doctrine of proportionality defended by the European Court of Human Rights. "

On October 5, 2011, The Pirate Bay registered the domain names depiraatbaai.be and baiedespirates.be so that Belgian users can access the website again without using alternate DNS providers.

On April 18, 2012, TorrentFreak reported that these two alternative domain names have also been banned, presumably adding to the pre-existing court order.


### 5. China


The site was briefly blocked, apparently unblocked, and blocked again with other BitTorrent sites in the People's Republic of China in November 2008. As of January 2017, it will no longer be accessible from mainland China (except Hong Kong and Macau).


### 6. Denmark


On February 5, 2008, the District Court of Frederiksberg, Copenhagen ruled that one of Denmark's largest ISPs, DMT2-Tele2, was helping its customers with copyright infringement by allowing the use of The Pirate Bay and that they would allow access to the? ˅. . Although the ISP had decided to challenge the verdict with the support of the Danish Telecommunications Industry Association, it stuck to it and blocked access to The Pirate Bay. Pirate Bay responded by creating an alternate site with instructions on how to bypass the block, while IFPI welcomed the block and encouraged other ISPs to follow suit. The verdict was upheld on November 26, 2008 in the Eastern High Court of Denmark. Following the court's decision, TDC, Denmark's largest ISP and owner of most of the cables, decided to block access to Pirate Bay as a preventive measure. Other Danish ISPs have commented that they would prefer not to disrupt their customers' communications, but reluctantly put the lock in place to avoid fines. For its part, Tele2's owner Telenor appealed the Supreme Court ruling to the Danish Supreme Court, which accepted the case in April 2009. In May 2010, the court denied the appeal and ordered Telenor to continue the lockdown.


### 7. Finland


On October 26, 2011, the Helsinki District Court ruled that Elisa Oyj, one of Finland's leading internet service providers, should stop providing copyrighted material from the Pirate Bay website before November 18, 2011, threatening a fine of 100,000 euros. On January 9, 2012, Elisa activated thepiratebay.org's IP and DNS-based ban. Elisa has filed a complaint about the District Court's ruling. Even DNA and Telia (formerly Sonera) are blocking access following a ruling by the Helsinki District Court in 2012. Together, these three operators, Elisa, Telia and DNA, have more than 80% of the Finnish market for internet operators.


### 8. France


On December 4, 2014, the High Court of Paris ordered major Internet service providers to block The Pirate Bay for the next two weeks.


### 9. Germany


On May 13, 2010, the Hamburg District Court ordered an injunction against CB3Rob Ltd & Co KG (Cyberbunker) and its operator Sven Olaf Kamphuis to prevent The Pirate Bay website from being connected to the Internet. The motion picture association member companies made the request for a precautionary measure.


### 10. Greece


In Greece, the Tellas / WIND Hellas ISPs blocked the site from February 15, 2010 to the end of March 2010 as a side effect of the blocking applied in Italy, as the traffic is apparently routed through the servers of the sister network Wind Italy. From November 9, 2018, all Greek providers are legally obliged to block access to the pirate bay for at least three years.

### 11. India


Pirate Bay and several other file sharing and video streaming sites were blocked in India on May 4, 2012 by order of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for no reason or prior warning. The suspension was due to the Madras High Court issuing an order from John Doe that was adopted by the Chennai-based Copyright Lab. The ban was enforced by various ISPs including Airtel, Reliance Communications, Tikona Digital Networks, Aircel, MTNL, BSNL and Vodafone. However, some ISPs such as You Broadband, Nextra Broadband, and Hathway did not enforce the ban. On May 19, 2012, the website continued to receive an error "This website / URL has been blocked until further notice, either under court orders or as directed by the Ministry of Telecommunications." In May 2012, the Reliance Communications server was hacked in protest by an anonymous group to demonstrate the security weakness used to implement the lockdown.

On June 22, 2012, the Madras High Court lifted the block, clarifying that only certain web addresses (or URLs) that contain illegal copies should be blocked, not the entire website. The decision restored access to video and file sharing sites in India, including The Pirate Bay.

In July 2014, the website was blocked again due to a violation of the guidelines regarding FIFA's broadcasting activities in countries. The message "This website has been blocked according to the instructions of the competent authority" shows visitors. Several ISPs, including BSNL, Airtel, and Vodafone India, continue to block the website even though they no longer display personalized messages when a user visits the Pirate Bay website. However, the website is still accessible to most other ISPs.


### 12. Indonesia


The pirate bay has been blocked by numerous Internet ISPs in Indonesia. Internet service providers who block you, including Indonesia's semi-private telecommunications company (Telkom Indonesia) through its wholly owned ISP TelkomSpeedy, and possibly a few other ISPs. Internet users in Indonesia who access this website (without proxy clients) will be redirected to another website called Internet Positif, which is managed by Kemkominfo (Indonesian Ministry of Telecommunications and Information). The website itself claims that The Pirate Bay is blocked due to malicious content such as pornographic material and others.


### 13. Ireland


In January 2009, Irish ISP Eircom, Ireland's largest Internet provider, was brought to justice by four major record labels, EMI, Sony, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group, for the ISP to monitor its customers and uncover illegal file sharing. After eight court days, the parties agreed to put in place a step-by-step response policy to segregate customers involved in copyright infringement activities. The Irish Recorded Music Association is still negotiating a similar agreement with other ISPs. However, on February 21, 2009, Eircom announced that access to Pirate Bay would soon be completely blocked. However, on February 24, 2009, access to The Pirate Bay was withdrawn. Eircom withdrew again on August 20, 2009 and announced that it would block the website from September. As of September 1, 2009, Eircom has blocked access to The Pirate Bay, although proxy servers can still be accessed and subscribers to other ISPs in Ireland can still access it.

In a ruling by Irish High Court Judge Peter Charleton on April 16, 2010, he ruled that the three-strike policy was legal and described Pirate Bay as "a website that, on a strange ideological basis, basically deals with robbery of the copyright law dedicates mainly musical works by the plaintiffs. "After the verdict, the judge was threatened that his life would be" destroyed by computers ".

In April 2011, the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice stated in a written statement that, in his view, no ISP can be obliged to filter the Internet and, in particular, not to enforce copyright law. In November 2011, the European Court of Justice mainly confirmed this view in a judgment.

In December 2011, a judgment was issued against Eircom's "Three Strikes" online file sharing system for reasons of data protection when recording IP addresses.

On June 12, 2013, EMI, Sony, Warner Music and Universal received a court order on behalf of UPC, Imagine, Vodafone, Digiweb, Hutchison 3G Ltd. and Telefónica O2 Ireland Ltd. to block access to The Pirate Bay and they have 30 days to do it. .


### 14. Iran


The pirate bay is currently blocked in Iran.


### 15. Italy


In mid-2008, the Italian association filed a lawsuit in Italy against music piracy in Milan following the criminal charges filed in Sweden. The deputy prosecutor brought the complaint to the Bergamo Preliminary Investigations Court, which decided on August 1, 2008 to block Italian Internet service providers from accessing all addresses in Pirate Bay. The judgment was based on the prevention of copyright infringement by users of the website on Italian territory. After the lockdown went into effect, The Pirate Bay responded on August 10, 2008 with instructions to repair the lock and create a separate site for Italians. However, shortly thereafter, the ISPs blocked the alternate site as well. Some ISPs had implemented the block by rerouting traffic from The Pirate Bay to a site owned by IFPI. Italian security expert Matteo Flora suggested that by redirecting the page in this way, IFPI could access the cookies of Italian users and impersonate them on the official website of The Pirate Bay. Two Italian IT lawyers, Giovanni Battista Gallus and Francesco Micozzi, and forensic scientist Matteo Flora appealed to the Bergamo court, which examined the case and overturned the original judgment on September 24, 2008. The decision to lift the blockade was based on the applicability of the "Freeze" section of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure, which cannot enforce action against parties unrelated to the potential crime (ISP to filter user traffic). With the April 2009 ruling in Sweden as a precedent, the Bergamo prosecutor appealed the Italian ruling to the Supreme Court of Cassation to restore the bloc. In September 2009, the Supreme Court overturned the decision to lift the bloc and the case was re-examined in the Bergamo Court. On February 8, 2010, the website was blocked again by the Italian Supreme Court. At least since 2014, the site in Italy has only been blocked at the DNS level with some ISPs. It is still completely accessible by the lesser known.


### 16. Malaysia


In June 2011, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission ordered The Pirate Bay along with several other file hosting websites to be blocked by a May 30 letter to all Malaysian ISPs for violating Section 41 of the Copyright Act 1987, which illegally copied has been . However, the blockade was lifted in July 2014. Malaysia blocked The Pirate Bay again from June 4, 2015. As of 2018, it appears to no longer be blocked due to a possible lack of interest and / or the change. government policy.


### 17. Holland


On July 21, 2005, the Amsterdam District Court held an injunction against those responsible for The Pirate Bay. The hearing followed a subpoena from the Dutch record industry association BREIN, which had an urgent complaint about copyright infringement by intermediaries. The defendants did not attend the hearing and had not agreed to represent them. Therefore, on July 30, 2009, the court issued a default judgment against them and accepted the applicants' claims. Neij, Kolmisoppi and Warg must "stop the copyright and related violations of the law by Stichting Brein (Brain Foundation) in the Netherlands and keep them in custody" within August 9, 2009, or face daily fines totaling 30,000 euros at a maximum of 3,000,000 euros . They were also sentenced to pay the legal costs. In a separate case, handled at the same time, the court ordered the same fines for The Pirate Bay's expected new owner, Global Gaming Factory X, for not ending copyright infringement after acquiring the site. According to Tim Kuik, director of BREIN, this is the first time that a foreign website has been instructed to block access from the Netherlands. However, BREIN waived the August damage payment and allowed the website to stay online until the expected change in ownership at the end of August 2009.

On October 2, 2009, The Pirate Bay's hosting services were relocated to Ukraine and traffic was routed through the Netherlands. However, BREIN contacted the NForce ISP and the service was discontinued. Pirate Bay then moved to a CyberBunker nuclear bunker on the outskirts of Kloetinge in the southern Netherlands.

On January 11, 2012, a court in The Hague ordered two Dutch Internet Service Providers (Ziggo and XS4ALL) to disable domain name searches from The Pirate Bay and block access to The Pirate Bay's IP addresses. They started doing this on January 31, 2012. Until the results of the appeal are available, they had to comply with the court order. On May 10, 2012, five more ISPs were ordered to block the site (specifically UPC, KPN, T-Mobile, Tele 2, and Telfort). Following a BREIN complaint, a court in The Hague ordered the Dutch Pirate Party to stop advertising for bypassing the blockade. This included linking to a proxy server offered by the Dutch Pirate Party, and the party claimed that it was also prevented by law from linking to the Tor project.

On January 28, 2014, the Hague Court of Appeals ruled that the ongoing blockade was ineffective and, moreover, easy to circumvent, ruling that Ziggo and XS4ALL were no longer obliged to block access to pirate bay. On November 13, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Appeal's findings on the effectiveness of the blockade ran counter to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and referred preliminary questions to the Court of Justice and asked whether the activities of The Pirate Bay are making a "notice the public "and, if not, a judicial ban can be granted against the ISPs that facilitate the infringing activities.

European judges ruled in 2017 that the previous ruling from 2012 does not violate European law, allowing national courts in the European Union to initiate copyrighted web blocks. The case was then referred back to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands, which was still ruling the matter in January 2018. However, with the decision of the European Court of Justice invalidating the 2014 decision, the ISPs were again forced to block Pirate Bay pending the decision of the Supreme Court. On January 12, this block was expanded to include the ISPs KPN, Tele2, T-Mobile, Zeelandnet and CAIW. Vodafone has been indirectly affected since the merger with Ziggo.

The blocking is done by DNS blocking.

On September 11, 2015, the two largest Norwegian internet providers Telenor and Altibox blocked their users' access to The Pirate Bay. Film producers such as Warner Bros., SF Norway and Disney won the court's favor on all aspects of a lawsuit against several of Norway's largest internet service providers.

Asker and the Bærum District Court denied claims by the copyright organization TONO by record artists against Norway's largest internet provider Telenor to block The Pirate Bay. In a court ruling dated November 6, 2009, the court found that it is not natural in today's society to require a private company to assess whether a website complies with the law, as such rulings are the responsibility of the authorities. .

One of the judges in the case later noted that the court order did not require the ISP to control its customers' access to the website, but the ISP wanted to avoid any risk.

On April 30, 2012, Judge Arnold Sky ordered Everything Everywhere, TalkTalk, O2 and Virgin Media to block access to the website. BT "asked for a few more weeks to review his position further." Virgin Media started blocking access to the website on May 2nd, 2012. A source at The Pirate Bay said it had 12 million more visitors than before the day after the ban, commenting, "We should thank the BIS".

BT has adjusted its cleanfeed system to enforce the ban. Pirate Bay commented, "As usual, there are easy ways to bypass the blockade. Use a VPN service to stay anonymous and get uncensored internet access. You have to do this anyway." A study by Lund University found that the number of 15-25 year olds using VPN has increased by 40% since 2009.

On June 10, 2012, TalkTalk began banning its UK customers from accessing the website. O2 and Sky Broadband implemented the block and on June 19th it was endorsed by BT. When you try to access The Pirate Bay through BT, you get an "Error: Site blocked" message. Other ISPs display a message explaining the court order with the Pirate Bay logo and a link to the BPI website.

In mid-July, ISP data suggested that P2P traffic in the UK fell 11% immediately after the lockdown, but then quickly recovered to near levels before the lockdown was enforced. "... the volumes are practically back where they were before." The ISP submitted the numbers anonymously to the BBC.

In December 2012, a proxy for The Pirate Bay website, operated by Pirate Party UK, was shut down after the UK recording industry threatened legal action.
